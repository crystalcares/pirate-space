# [Fix] Anonymous Exchange Update
This migration fixes a critical bug where anonymous (guest) users could not submit their recipient address after creating an exchange. The previous RLS policy for updates on the `exchanges` table was too restrictive.

## Query Description:
- **DROP POLICIES**: Removes potentially existing old policies on the `exchanges` table to prevent conflicts.
- **ENABLE RLS**: Ensures Row Level Security is active on the table.
- **CREATE POLICY (SELECT)**: Re-establishes a secure read policy. Authenticated users can read their own exchanges. Anonymous users can only read a specific guest exchange (where `user_id` is NULL), which is safe because they need to know the unguessable UUID.
- **CREATE POLICY (INSERT)**: Re-establishes the policy allowing both authenticated and anonymous users to create new exchanges.
- **CREATE POLICY (UPDATE)**: This is the core fix. It creates a new update policy with the following logic:
    1. Authenticated users can update their own exchanges.
    2. Anonymous users can update an exchange IF it's a guest exchange (`user_id` is NULL) AND the `recipient_wallet_address` has NOT been set yet. This makes the address submission a one-time operation for guests, enhancing security.
- **CREATE POLICY (DELETE)**: Restricts deletion to admins only, using the `is_admin` function.

This change is crucial for the guest checkout flow to function correctly.

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: "Structural"
- Impact-Level: "Medium"
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: true (by restoring the old policies)

## Structure Details:
- Table: `public.exchanges`
- Policies Affected: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: Enabled
- Policy Changes: Yes. The `UPDATE` policy is modified to allow a one-time update for anonymous users under specific conditions.
- Auth Requirements: Affects `anon` and `authenticated` roles.

## Performance Impact:
- Estimated Impact: Negligible.
