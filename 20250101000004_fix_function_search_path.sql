# [Fix Function Search Path]
[This operation secures the `get_exchange_id` function by explicitly setting its `search_path`. This prevents potential hijacking of the function by malicious actors who might create objects with the same name in other schemas.]

## Query Description: [This operation modifies an existing database function to enhance security. It sets a fixed search path, ensuring that the function's behavior is predictable and not influenced by the session's search path. There is no risk to existing data.]

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: "Security"
- Impact-Level: "Low"
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: true

## Structure Details:
- Modifies function: `public.get_exchange_id()`

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: Not applicable
- Policy Changes: No
- Auth Requirements: None
- Mitigates: Search path hijacking vulnerability.

## Performance Impact:
- Indexes: None
- Triggers: None
- Estimated Impact: Negligible performance impact.
